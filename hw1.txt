		2. git log -3
	Part C:
		When you use git commit, you are making the file you are committing as part of repository. You have to enter a message associated with the commit. Since there is no message, the terminal will prompt you to enter a message.

Problem 6:
	3. The store manager is problematic because when you want to free up the buffer at a specific starting point, the program will overwrite everything after the starting location with the null character.Since there is already a pointer pointing to another index in the buffer, erasing the value to which the pointer is pointing to, to null, will make the pointer ultimately point to null.
