Scrabble Part 2:
I used Jamie's code. To compile scrabble, just type make all into the terminal. Then in order to run it, you must type ./scrabble along with the name of the config.txt file. I have included two additional files called permute.cpp and CPUL.cpp In permute.cpp, I have a function called permute that essentially gets passed in a string of characters and from that set of strings, prints out all the possible permutations of that string along with the permutations of the substrings. In my hw8 folder, I have also included the Trie.h and the Trie.cpp which have been tested and have passed test cases. For scrabble part 2, I have made it so that it clearly creates a board when given an init file in the config.txt file. If not init.txt file exists, then it will just create a board that is blank. 

To compile: make all
To run: ./scrabble config.txt
