For this project, it was by far the hardest assignment I've ever had at USC.
Due to the amount of files we were given from the skeleton code, this task was not easy. For the most part, I was able to grasp the objective of every function while finding ways such as friending classes to attain access to private members and functions.
Where I struggled the most was trying to piece together all the functions and have it work. The most challenging .cpp file I had to work with was definitely the placeMove.cpp because of the checks we had to do for valid move.
While some such as out of bounds and adjacency checks were easy, the check to make sure all words formed on the board were valif was the hardest. This function is called formedWords in my placeMove.cpp. 
Due to time and using my grace day, I was not able to fully test whether scrabble worked properly or not. There are so many areas where any little mistake could throw off the game or make it seg fault. 
My problem too was trying to get the score from the tiles in the player's hand. I couldn't quite get that part to work. I tried my hardest.
