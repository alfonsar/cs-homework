For the question 1 answer, I uploaded as a PDF under the filename Question1.pdf. For Question 2 and Question 4C about merge sort, those answers will be located inside the hw5.txt file. Also, msort.h was way more complicated than I thought originally but with this homework problem I realized how complicated and useful templates can be.

Files to be graded:
Question1.pdf
hw5.txt
cave.cpp
fatalist.cpp
functor.cpp
functor.h
msort.h
